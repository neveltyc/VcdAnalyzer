## Why VCD Analyzer?

You have a giant `.vcd` dump from simulation and you need to know what happened to `state[3:0]`
between 17.3 us and 17.6 us. Opening GTKWave means waiting for the GUI, clicking through the
hierarchy, zooming in, squinting at values. This tool gives you the answer in one command.

It is also designed from the ground up for **agent-assisted workflows**: every command has a
`--json` mode that emits compact, machine-readable output so LLM agents can inspect waveforms
without a GUI.

```bash
python vcd_analyzer.py search sim.vcd --condition "state=5" --show data,valid --begin 17us
```

## Quick start

```bash
# What's in this file?
python vcd_analyzer.py info sim.vcd

# Show me the clock and reset
python vcd_analyzer.py list sim.vcd --filter clk,rst

# What happened between 100 ns and 200 ns?
python vcd_analyzer.py dump sim.vcd --begin 100ns --end 200ns --filter state

# When was valid=1 AND ready=1 at the same time?
python vcd_analyzer.py search sim.vcd --condition "valid=1,ready=1" --show data

# When did req transition while ready was low?
python vcd_analyzer.py search sim.vcd --condition "changed(req),ready=0" --show state

# When did ANY of several channels handshake? (repeat --condition to OR)
python vcd_analyzer.py search sim.vcd --condition "ch0_valid=1,ch0_ready=1" \
                                      --condition "ch1_valid=1,ch1_ready=1"

# Give me a snapshot at exactly 17.55 us
python vcd_analyzer.py snapshot sim.vcd --at 17.55us --filter state,init_done

# Any signal change count, static vs active?
python vcd_analyzer.py summary sim.vcd --filter dll_*
```

## Install

Single file, no dependencies, Python 3.9+.

```bash
# Latest
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neveltyc/VCD_ANALYZER/main/vcd_analyzer.py -o vcd_analyzer.py

# Pinned published release tag (recommended — avoids compatibility surprises from main)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neveltyc/VCD_ANALYZER/v1.5.2/vcd_analyzer.py -o vcd_analyzer.py

# Verify
python vcd_analyzer.py --version
```

No pip, no venv, no PyPI. Works anywhere curl and Python 3.9+ are available — CI containers, EDA servers, Docker builds, agent toolchains.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|:--------|:-------------|
| `info` | Timescale, signal count, time span, scopes &mdash; the file at a glance |
| `list` | Enumerate signals with path, width, and type |
| `dump` | Print every value change in a time window, in order |
| `summary` | Per-signal stats: active/static, change count, rise/fall edges |
| `snapshot` | What are all known signal values at time T? |
| `compare` | What changed between T1 and T2? |
| `search` | Find intervals where conditions hold, optionally watching related signals |

All commands accept `--begin` / `--end` time windows with unit suffixes (`fs`, `ps`, `ns`, `us`, `ms`, `s`),
`--filter` with substring or glob patterns, and `--json` for structured output.

Run `python vcd_analyzer.py --help` for the full reference.

## JSON output

Every command emits compact structured JSON under `--json`. Agents and scripts
get raw tick counts (`_ticks`) alongside human-readable times (`_h`).

```bash
python vcd_analyzer.py --json info sim.vcd
python vcd_analyzer.py --json search sim.vcd --condition "state=5" --show data
```

## Semantics notes

- **Multiple value changes per timestamp are preserved.** The IEEE 1364 grammar
  allows several value changes to the same signal within one timestamp
  (delta-cycle style writers); `dump` shows all of them in order and `summary`
  counts each transition. A record that only re-asserts a signal's current
  value — a consecutive duplicate, or a `$dumpall`/`$dumpon` checkpoint
  re-emitting the current value — is a no-op and adds no change event (so
  `summary` static/active accounting stays exact).
- **`search` conditions are AND clauses; repeating `--condition` ORs them.**
  One `--condition` is a comma-separated AND list of `SIG=VAL`, `SIG!=VAL`, or
  `changed(SIG)` terms. Repeat the flag and the search holds wherever *any*
  clause holds (OR-of-ANDs) — one clause per channel to find when any
  handshakes. There is no in-string OR: `|` and `OR` inside a condition are
  ordinary text and are rejected, so a mis-typed boolean is an error rather
  than a confident empty result.
- **`changed(SIG)` is an edge predicate**, true at exactly the ticks where SIG
  transitions, and it switches `search` to event mode (instants instead of
  intervals). Every clause must then carry one, or none may. Level terms in
  the clause read the tick's **settled** state, so the answer never depends on
  the order same-tick records happen to be written in; the transitioning
  signal itself reads the value it took **at that edge**, so
  `"changed(s),s=1"` means "rising edge of s". `changed(a),changed(b)` asks for
  both to transition on one tick.
- **Condition matching follows a signal's declared type.** A real/realtime
  signal is compared numerically (`dac=3.14`, `dac=100`), never as a bit
  string — its `%g` text would otherwise read as binary, making `dac=4` match
  a real 100.0. An event variable has no level, so `ev=1` is refused with a
  pointer to `changed(ev)`.
- **Time windows.** With no `--end`, the effective end is the file's last
  timestamp, and a `--begin` past it is an error. With an explicit `--end`
  beyond the last timestamp, the last known state is extended into the window
  (the same last-known-value persistence used by `snapshot`/`compare`).

## Single file, zero dependencies

`vcd_analyzer.py` is pure Python with no third-party imports. No pip install, no virtualenv
ritual &mdash; drop it anywhere with Python 3.9+ and it works.

## Agent skill

This repository includes a [skill/SKILL.md](skill/SKILL.md) for AI coding agents
(Codex, Claude Code, etc.). Install it directly from this repo and your agent
will know how to use all seven commands, pick the right one for each task,
parse JSON output, and follow proven debug workflows.

The skill covers the full command reference, decision tree, five workflow
patterns, condition syntax, error recovery, and environment variable tuning.

## Version history

Full per-version notes live on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/neveltyc/VCD_ANALYZER/releases) page. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a quick overview.

| Version | Highlight |
|:--------|:----------|
| `1.5.2` | `dump --begin` no longer invents value changes: the mid-file catch-up scan carries the no-op baseline across the window edge, so a `$dumpall`/`$dumpon` checkpoint re-asserting current values — iverilog emits one by default — stays a no-op exactly as in a full scan |
| `1.5.1` | Parser keeps non-finite real values (`inf`/`-inf`/`nan`, including C99 `nan(payload)` forms like `nan(ind)` — previously the whole record was silently dropped); `summary` caps its per-signal unique-value set (`VCD_ANALYZER_MAX_UNIQUE_VALUES`, default 65536, lower bound flagged as `unique_is_exact: false`); Ctrl-C exits 130 instead of a traceback; stdout/stderr forced to UTF-8 |
| `1.5.0` | `changed(SIG)` edge predicate replaces the `--changed` flag; repeatable `--condition` ORs clauses; condition matching follows the signal's declared type (fixes real-signal false positives/negatives); unusable condition targets are rejected instead of silently unmatched; `--limit` default 500 with a clearer truncation notice |
| `1.4.0` | Internal refactor: separate the event stream from derived state into three distinct parser views (`iter_events` raw / `iter_transitions` / `state_at` snapshots); no change to any command's output, value-change hot path slightly faster |
| `1.3.20` | Preserve intra-timestamp value changes; rebuild `info`'s time range on one forward scanner (parser-parity, ~1.5× faster, survives huge/`$dumpall` tails); `search --changed` counts each change; `info` `--limit` validation and empty-data output |
| `1.3.19` | Fix free-format VCD correctness: multi-declaration/timestamp-per-line, quiet-window search, rejected-token cascade, `$dumpall` change count |
| `1.3.18` | Fix `info` `time_max` collapsing to `time_min` on indented VCD files |
| `1.3.17` | Common-shape fast path in the `$var` parser (skip bracket scans) |
| `1.3.16` | Inline the over-wide clamp guard on the value-change hot path |
| `1.3.15` | Chunked data tokenizer and one-line header fast path |
| `1.3.14` | Stream `dump` text output; add benchmark harness |
